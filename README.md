# Requirements Village

*Where project ideas get laid to rest.*

Requirements Village is a full-stack application for organizing software project ideas â€” especially the ones you may never finish. It provides a structured home for your someday/maybe/wishlist projects and lets you define tech stacks, components, and deployment plans for each one.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit
- **Backend:** C# Minimal API
- **Authentication:** ASP.NET Core Identity  
- **Data Layer:** Entity Framework Core
- **Database:** SQLite

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

The application features a Gothic aesthetic with polished irreverence, as demonstrated in the mockups found in `./assets/claude/`. The design balances professional SaaS functionality with a playful "project graveyard" theme.
